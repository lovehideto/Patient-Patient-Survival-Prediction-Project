## Problem Statement:

The potential client for this project could be healthcare providers or medical researchers who want to analyze patient data to improve patient care and develop new treatments. The client's motivation is to make data-driven decisions and improve patient outcomes. They care about this problem because analyzing patient data can help them understand patient needs, identify patterns, and develop personalized treatments. 

So, I build a classification model to predict if the patient will survive in the hospital. By analyzing the feature importance of our model, we can help our client to help healthcare providers improve patient outcomes, improve patient care, reduce costs, and optimize resource utilization.

## Data Source:
I use the data from kaggle [Kaggle Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mitishaagarwal/patient/data)

## Outcome
Build a prediction model, the model improved the predictive power more than 10 times.
